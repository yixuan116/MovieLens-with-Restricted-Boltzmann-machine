# RBM RecSys (MovieLens 20M)

This repository implements a modular, production-style Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) recommender in PyTorch with strong engineering hygiene: reproducibility, baselines, structured evaluation, and artifact outputs.

The RBM is treated as a latent-structure inference layer. The pipeline emphasizes structural decomposition, stability analysis via convergence curves, and compatibility with decision-layer integration.

## Model Architecture and Training Pipeline

This section explains the full recommendation architecture used in this project, from MovieLens data to RBM representation learning and then to hyperbolic neural dynamics.

### 1. Data Representation

The MovieLens dataset is converted into a user–movie interaction matrix.

- Shape: 2000 × 1320
- Rows represent users
- Columns represent movies
- Each row is one training sample

The 2000×1320 matrix is the training dataset, not a neural network layer.
The RBM visible layer size is determined by the number of movies, which is 1320.

(final recommendation)
```

The RBM learns latent user preference factors from the visible movie ratings.
The hidden layer captures abstract taste features.
The reconstruction step predicts missing movie preferences.

The hyperbolic mapping converts binary states into hyperbolic-valued states.
The hyperbolic network dynamics compute stable equilibrium states.

### 3. RBM Training Loop

Hidden activation

h = σ(Wᵀv + b)

v̂ = σ(Wh + a)

Contrastive Divergence

ΔW = v hᵀ − v̂ ĥᵀ

Update weights

W ← W + ηΔW

RBM training alternates between visible and hidden layers.
The model learns weights that minimize reconstruction error.

This process discovers latent preference structures in the movie space.

### 4. Energy Landscape Intuition

Traditional real-valued networks can exhibit oscillatory dynamics.
Hyperbolic-valued states introduce exponential geometry that promotes convergence.

The hyperbolic energy landscape forms stable attractor basins.
This helps the system reach equilibrium states more reliably.

### Why Hyperbolic Dynamics Can Be More Stable than Euclidean Dynamics

Using hyperbolic-valued states instead of standard real-valued states can promote more stable convergence in iterative updates. The geometry can reduce oscillatory update behavior and can form stronger attractor-like dynamics that pull trajectories toward equilibrium. This is an intuition rather than a guarantee, but it helps motivate why hyperbolic dynamics are explored in this project.

```text
Euclidean / Real-Valued Dynamics

state update trajectory:

x0  →  x1  →  x2  →  x3  →  x4
 \        ↘      ↗      ↘
  \        unstable oscillation
   \_____________________________

Result:
- trajectories may oscillate
- updates may wander
- convergence can be slow or unstable

    \________\________\____  attractor basin

Result:
- trajectories are pulled into a stable basin
- updates contract toward equilibrium
- convergence is more reliable
```

## RBM Math Walkthrough (Full Derivation)

This section mirrors the implementation in `src/rbm.py` and expands the math flow into a complete derivation.

### 1) Model definition and joint distribution

We use a Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM with visible vector v in {0,1}^V and hidden vector h in {0,1}^H.

Energy:

```math
E(v, h) = - v^T W h - b^T v - c^T h
```
where:
- W is V x H weight matrix
- b is visible bias
- c is hidden bias

The joint distribution is:

```math
P(v, h) = \frac{\exp(-E(v, h))}{Z}
```
Z is the partition function, and the marginals are:

```math
P(v) = \sum_h P(v, h), \quad P(h) = \sum_v P(v, h)
```

### 2) Conditional probabilities

Because RBM has bipartite structure:

```math
P(h_j = 1 \mid v) = \sigma((v W)_j + c_j)
```

```math
P(v_i = 1 \mid h) = \sigma((h W^T)_i + b_i)
```

Derivation sketch for the hidden conditional:

```math
P(h_j = 1 \mid v) = \frac{\exp(v^T W_{:,j} + c_j)}{1 + \exp(v^T W_{:,j} + c_j)}
```

These are implemented in:
- `sample_h()` and `sample_v()` in `src/rbm.py`

### 3) Free energy

Marginal over h gives free energy:

```math
F(v) = - b^T v - \sum_j \log(1 + \exp((v W)_j + c_j))
```

Derivation:

```math
P(v) = \frac{1}{Z} \sum_h \exp(-E(v,h))
```

```math
\sum_h \exp(-E(v,h)) = \exp(b^T v) \prod_j (1 + \exp((vW)_j + c_j))
```
Therefore:

```math
P(v) = \frac{\exp(-F(v))}{Z}
```

### 4) Log-likelihood gradient

We maximize log-likelihood:

```math
\mathcal{L} = \sum_{v \in \text{data}} \log P(v)
```
For one data vector v:

```math
\nabla_W \log P(v) = -\nabla_W F(v) - \nabla_W \log Z
```
The first term is the positive phase:

```math
-\nabla_W F(v) = v \, \mathbb{E}_{P(h \mid v)}[h]^T
```
The second term is the negative phase:

```math
\nabla_W \log Z = \mathbb{E}_{P(v,h)}[v h^T]
```

So the gradient for W is:

```math
\nabla_W = \mathbb{E}_{data}[v h^T] - \mathbb{E}_{model}[v h^T]
```
This is the difference between:
- Positive phase: expectation under data distribution
- Negative phase: expectation under model distribution

Similarly for biases:

```math
\nabla_b = \mathbb{E}_{data}[v] - \mathbb{E}_{model}[v]
```

```math
\nabla_c = \mathbb{E}_{data}[h] - \mathbb{E}_{model}[h]
```

### 5) Contrastive Divergence (CD-k)

We approximate the negative phase by running a k-step Gibbs chain:

```math
v_0 \rightarrow h_0 \rightarrow v_1 \rightarrow h_1 \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow v_k \rightarrow h_k
```

Update rules (using probabilities):

```math
W \leftarrow W + \eta \frac{v_0^T h_0^{prob} - (v_k^{prob})^T h_k^{prob}}{batch}
```

```math
b \leftarrow b + \eta \, mean(v_0 - v_k^{prob})
```

```math
c \leftarrow c + \eta \, mean(h_0^{prob} - h_k^{prob})
```

Interpretation:
- v_0, h_0 are from the data-driven positive phase
- v_k, h_k are from the model-driven negative phase after k Gibbs steps
- k is small (e.g., 1, 5) for efficient approximation

This corresponds to `contrastive_divergence()` in `src/rbm.py`.

### 6) Reconstruction loss (monitoring)

We track:

```math
L = BCE(v_k^{prob}, v_0)
```
as a stability/convergence signal (not the exact negative log-likelihood).

## Conceptual Framing

This project emphasizes RBM as a **latent-state discovery engine**, aligned to downstream decision-layer objectives (e.g., regime detection, risk segmentation, policy integration). The same structural inference pattern can be adapted beyond recommendation systems.
